CREATING A NEW REQUEST

Before we go into detail, I should say now that it is unlikely you'll be
able to construct a new request without investigating what's available first.
This investigation is done with the betadataservices module and I will point
out how as we go on. Just note I will call the module bds from here, as if
doing,

import betadataservices as bds

Firstly, each request must start with 'START REQUEST' and end with
'END REQUEST'. Here is an example...


START REQUEST
var_name=temperature
model_feed=UKPPBEST
coverage_id=UKPPBEST_latest_AGL
components=temperature
format=NetCDF3
elevation=100, 700
bbox=-14.0, 47.5, 7.0, 61.0
time=2015-06-24T06:00:00Z
width=100
height=100
interpolation=bilinear
END REQUEST


Let's look at each parameter.

COMPULSORY PARAMETERS.

var_name    - This is completely up to you, it is only used in the filename
              so call it something that describes the variable.

model_feed  - The model from which the data comes. Use
              bds.available_model_feeds() to see what's available.

coverage_id - With the chosen model feed, initial a bds.WCS2Requester and use
              the getCapabilities() method to list available coverage ids.

components  - With the chosen coverage id, use the describeCoverage() method
              to list available components.

format      - At time of writing, available formats are not returned by BDS
              WCS2 requests, however NetCDF3 or GRIB2 should work!


NON COMPULSORY PARAMETERS.

If any of these are not given, BDS will return some default.
Parameters labelled 'Bounded' mean giving one value will extract that value,
but if two values are given, they are treated as bounds.

elevation     - Bounded. Specify the Z values to extract. Units are assumed, so
                just provide the values. Default is all.

bbox          - Specify the XY bounding box. This must be in the format
                "x-min, y-min, x-max, y-max". Default is all.

time          - Bounded. Specify the forecasted time(s). ISO time format is
                recommended but most common time formats are accepted. Default
                is all.

width/height  - The number of gridpoints in the X (width) and/or Y (height)
                within the bounding box. The given interpolation (see below)
                is used. Default is the native grid spacing of the data.

interpolation - The interpolation method used if data is re-gridded. Default is
                nearest-neighbour.
